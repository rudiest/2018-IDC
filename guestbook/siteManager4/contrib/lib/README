This directory contains optional libraries that may be helpful for
creating SiteManager sites.

CONTRIBUTED LIBRARIES:
----------------------

- smSaveForm.inc

        This library may be used to save a SmartForm to the current SmartForm XML format.
        In this way, you can build a form in code, and save it out to XML for later use, by
        loading it through the SM_smartForm::loadForm() method.
        
- columnDefinition.inc
- dbEditorAction.inc
- dbGuiBaseHook.inc
- dbGuiMySqlHook.inc
- mainDbEditorActions.inc        

        These are all part of the new DB GUI system, which is an expandable system for
        creating SmartForms based on database tables on the fly, by reading the table
        structure, and allowing various opertions to be performed on the table (add, remove, etc)
        (see also contri/modules/abstractDbEditor.mod, dbGui.mod, dbRecordSelector.mod)
    
        
- orderItem.inc
- orders.inc

        Some basic classes that may be used as a base for a shopping cart system
        (see also contrib/modules/store.mod)
