HOW YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE SITEMANAGER PROJECT
--------------------------------------------------

OpenSource Explanation 

    The SiteManager libraries are Open Source. This means everyone is invited to
    distribute, use, review, and change the SiteManager libraries at no charge.
    
    We encourage everyone to review the code, suggest improvements, write
    bugfixes or new functionality and send them to us. Read on and find out
    how you can help and what do to with your improvements.

    There are certain restrictions with regard to changing the library, specifically
    with how to distribute your changes. Please see our license agreement, which is
    based on the QPL created by Troll Tech Software (www.trolltech.com), in the
    file LICENSE in the /doc directory or online at
    http://www.roadsend.com/license/rpl1.txt

How You Can Help
----------------

 - Submit Feedback
 
    The easiest way to help is simply to use the product and let us know what you think.
    We'd like to hear your thoughts on how it works (or why it doesn't). We'd like to
    know if you like the way it's laid out, if the documentation helped, if it fits
    within the framework of your development environment. We'd like to know what new
    features you'd like to see and what other tools we could create to make things 
    easier.

 - Modules, Templates
 - SmartForm entities, filters
 
    We envision a time in the not too distant future where there will be any number of
    modules, templates, Smart Form entities and filters freely available from different
    sources throughout the net. We'd like to see module designers creating pluggable
    modules that anyone can use in their SiteManager sites. Likewise, if you come up
    with a good SmartForm entity that others could use, we encourage you to share it,
    and possibly make it part of the standard SiteManager distribution.

 - New functionality
 
    If you've got a new idea for SiteManager you'd like to see implemented, why not
    write it an send us a patch? We'll review your submission and put it into the
    main distribution if we think it would fit into the SiteManager system. Of course
    your own work is copywritten and you would receive credit in the documentation.

 - Bug fixes
 
    We're certainly not bold enough to say SiteManager is bug free. If you've come across
    a bug, fix it and send us a patch. We'd be happy to credit you in the change log.

 - Testing
 
    We'd like all feedback related to how it works on various platforms, in different
    development environments, and with different database backends.
