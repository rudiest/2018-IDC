<title>General Information</title>


<section>
<title>Version Numbering</title>
<para>
SiteManager follows a version scheme that consists of three numbers - for example, 2.1.11
</para>

<para>
The first number (MAJOR) indicates the version of the underlying architecture. All releases with the same
first number have the same underlying architecture. Releases with different MAJOR numbers are not guaranteed
to be 100% compatible with each other.
</para>

<para>
The second number (MINOR) indicates the development state. If the second number is even, the version is a
"stable" release. If odd, it's a development release and should not be used for production quality sites.
</para>

<para>
The third number (RELEASE) indicates the version within this release level. Different versions in the same release level may
contain bug fixes or new features, but should be back wards compatible with previous versions in the same release level.

<title>Security Concerns</title>

<para>

    We recommend you make all of the SiteManager Resource Files unreadable by the webserver,
    except ".php" files. The rest are not meant to be seen by users.
</>

<para>
    The following line will accomplish this in Apache:
</>

<programlisting>
    # don't allow access to SiteManager files
    &lt;FilesMatch "\.(inc|tpt|stp|mod|xsm|cpt)$"&gt;
        Order allow,deny
        Deny from all
    &lt/FilesMatch&gt;
</programlisting>

<para>
In addition, the "admin" directory should not contain content that is publically accessible. We recommend you 
disallow any direct access to files in this directory and it's subdirectories.
</para>

<para>
Check your web servers documentation for more information.
</para>

</section>

<section>
<title>Directory Layout</title>

<para>
    Every site run by SiteManager has a common directory structure (on UNIX, this is commonly found in <filename>/var/www/myProject</> or <filename>/home/httpd/html/myProject</>).
    It may contain some or all of the following directories.
</para>

<programlisting>
    /                       - (root)
    /admin                  - (admin / config directory)
        /modules            - (local site modules)
        /templates          - (local site templates)
        /smartForms         - (local site smartForms)
        /config             - (local site configuration files)
        /codePlates         - (local site codePlates)
        /smTags             - (local site SM tags)
        /lib                - (local library of routines)
        /locale             - (localization files)
    /home                   - (main page/directive script directory)
    /images                 - (main images directory)    
</programlisting>

<para>    
    All files in <filename>/admin</> should be protected from reading by the webserver.
    None of these files located in this directory or it's subdirectory should
    be readable by a user requesting them through the web. The best way to stop
    this is the stop the webserver from reading the file types found in these 
    directories. Alternatively, you can tell the webserver not to serve any files
    under the <filename>admin/</> directory.
</para>

<para>
    For even better security, you can move the directories underneath <filename>admin/</> to a
    directory outside of the web document root. This is the most secure, as configuration files will then
    be unavailable to web clients. The only required file in the web root will be <filename>common.inc</filename>, which
    will be accessed by the directive scripts. If you need to, <filename>common.inc</> can be renamed to <filename>common.inc.php</> (just make sure
    your directive scripts access it this way!).
</para>
    
<para>
    SiteManager itself contains the following directory structure (on UNIX, this is commonly
    found in <filename>/usr/local/lib/php/</>)
</para>    

<programlisting>    
    /                       - (root)
    /bin                    - (binary files/scripts 
                               for maintenance and automation)
    /cache                  - (resource cache directory)
    /config                 - (configuration files, 
                               ie globalConfig.xsm)
    /contrib                - (contributed code available for your sites)                                  
        /lib                - (contributed routines)
        /modules            - (contributed modules)
        /templates          - (contributed templates and codePlates)
    /doc                    - (documentation, LICENSE, etc)
    /lib                    - (main lib directory)
        /configReaders      - (SMCONFIG readers)
        /memberSystems      - (member systems)
        /sessionContainers  - (session system containers)
        /smTags             - (SM template tags)
        /sfFilters          - (SmartForm filters)
        /sfInputEntities    - (SmartForm input entities)
    /redist                 - (redistributed code used by Sitemanager)
    /skeletonSite           - (skeleton site used for 
                               template when creating new site)
    /tables                 - (SQL table creation scripts)
    /testSite               - (Fully functional test site)
