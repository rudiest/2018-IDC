How did you generate the API documentation from your code comments?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
<para>
We used PHPDoc to generate the API documentation. It requires you to
       comment your code in a particular way, but it's well worth it.
       You can find this program at: http://phpdocu.sourceforge.net

<question>
<para>
Can I install SiteManager if I don't have root access?
</para>
</question>
<answer>
    
<para>
Yes, but you must have access to .htaccess (apache). You can
       do everything in this file you do normally through the main
       apache config file, and the main php file. The .htaccess file
       should be located in your root web document directory.
</para>
              
<para>
       It should contain the following lines:
</para>

       
<para>
<programlisting>

       # don't allow access to SiteManager files
       &lt;FilesMatch "\.(inc|tpt|stp|mod|xsm|cpt)$"&gt;
            Order allow,deny
            Deny from all
       &lt;/FilesMatch&gt; 
       
       # include SiteManager directory
       php_value include_path /var/www/users/username/siteManager:/usr/local/lib/php
       
</>
</para>
       
<para>
       Alternatively, you can leave out the php_value include_path statement,
       and edit siteManager.inc. Edit the $SM_rootDir directory to point to
       the main SiteManager root directory. If you do this, you don't need
       to have it in the PHP path.
</para>

<para>
       If you do it this way, you will also have to specify the full path to
       siteManager.inc in your admin/common.inc file
</para>

<para>
I'm trying to use the $SM_siteManager class, but I keep getting errors.
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
Make sure it's declared as global. Remember, PHP requires you to declare
       globals variables inside of functions and classes. It doesn't automatically
       give you access to all global variables. Since SM_siteManager is global,
       if you're in a function or a function within a class, you must declare it
       global before gaining access to it:
</para>

<para>
<programlisting>

       // declare SM_siteManager global       
       global $SM_siteManager;
       
</>
</para>
