2.5.4 Changes [2.6.0 final] (release 2/19/06)
--------------------------------------
- NEW: new extended tag syntax. "allowExtendedTags" must be true in the config.
       the format is <SM TYPE="tagname">some data can go here</SM>
       the data in the middle will be accessible through $tag->data
- UPD: allow proper XHTML SM tags: <SM .. />
- UPD: SM_module::eventBadInvar now takes second parameter that contains
	type check that failed, if any
- NEW: new directives added to dateEntity. showMonth, showDay, and showYear were added so that you can
	   turn off specfic pulldowns. All 3 directives are initially set to true (so all 3 pulldowns are
	   are shown by default) (gollum 1/19/2005)
- NEW: new directives in dateEntity. addNoOption, noOptionData, and noOptionDisplay were added to
       the date entity and should act similar to their counterparts in a select entity. (gollum 10/25/2004)
- NEW: new smartform filter: "xml" to force proper XML input
- NEW: smart form xml files now parse $variables for their values the same
       way SMCONFIG files do 
- UPD: updated auth.inc so that it could handle newer php $_SERVER var and still be backwardsly
       compatible ($PHP_AUTH_USER or $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER'] and $PHP_AUTH_PW or $_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_PW'])
       (gollum 09/21/2004)
- UPD: removed redundant directive (optionBreak) from checkBoxEntity (gollum 09/21/2004)
- UPD: Made minor changes to smInVarClient->verifyInVars which allows it to give the bad inVar back tp the
        calling function. made minor changes in smCodePlate and smModules to display this returned value
        if SM_develState is true.
- UPD: In setInfo function of SM_entityFilter, added a check to $_FILES in addition to the check to $_POST
		for data for the entity. This gets the data for any file input entity. (gollum 07/22/2004)

2.5.3 Changes (release 7/6/04)
--------------------------------------
- NEW: add LDAP membersystem. contributed by Vaggelis haniotak@ucnetnom.ucnet.uoc.gr
- NEW: add PULINK tag for making popup links in templates
- FIX: handle anchors properly in sessionH::ulink
- NEW: added a check in smSession.inc to see if we are in 'CLI' mode or not. If we are, then 
       we force 'useCookies' to be 'none' (gollum 6/18/2004)
- UPD: add option in credit card filter of not allowing known sample cards.
- NEW: revamp session negotiation. SiteManager will now attempt to detect cookies on the clients
       machine. if found it will keep the session id in the cookie. if not, it will pass session
       id on all links. this feature is turned on by the session GCS variable "useCookie" which
       can be set to "auto", "none" or "require"
- UPD: changed siteConfig's getVar function to be a little more efficent.
- UPD: major changes to SM_siteManagerRoot's _findSMfile_disk function so that it makes less calls to 
       'file_exists' function. This should increase speed and preformance and shouldn't break any functionality.
- UPD: handle error that happen early in the startup more gracefully (ie, during read of globalConfig)
- FIX: as of PHP 4.3.4, XML_CASE_FOLDING option needs to be 1, not true
- NEW: Added a directive to 'fileSelectEntity' calle 'fileNameFilter' which should be a regular expression that
       is used to filter the names put in the select entity.
- FIX: Added 'hasFormRun' var to SM_smartForm to track if the runForm function has been called. If
       dataVerified is called and the form hasn't been run yet, dataVerified runs the form. This fixes
       a problem where filters weren't being checked because the form hadn't been run yet and dataVerified
       was returing true when it should have been returning false.
- NEW: add directive optionAlign to radio entity which will put options in a table to align them nicley  
- FIX: Changed textAreaEnitiy to pass $this->value thru the htmlspecialchars() function just before 
       displaying the textarea tag. Because of the fact that the actual text in a textarea tag is between
       the '<textarea>' and '</textarea>' the browser was converting any special characters to html.
       For example, this would eventually cause the text '&gt;' to become '>', which isn't what we want.
- NEW: Added 2 directives in globalConfig.xsm trackLastPageAccess in sessions and inactiveTTl in members. If
       trackLastPageAccess is set to true, the session system will keep track of when the last time any page was
       accessed. If trackLastPageLoad is true, inactiveTTL is used to log members out after a certian amount of
       time (in seconds) of being inactive. If inactiveTTL is 0 or less, it will not log members out.
- UPD: remove SiteManager C extension support (deprecated)
- UPD: change SiteManager root object bootstrapping so that initial setup doesn't happen in constructor. 
       This avoids potentially calling an object that hasn't been initialized yet.

2.5.2 Changes (release 9/03/03)
--------------------------------------
- FIX: fix dbSelectEntity for oracle users. generated an invalid query. thanks to Tero Ykspetaja
- FIX: allow quote characters in textEntity values by converting to html &quot entity
- UPD: fix all access to PEAR DB objects to conform to proper API calls. fixes problems with newer versions on 
       PEAR DB routines.
- UPD: update to latest PEAR DB redistribution. remove Date/Calc.php and Var_Dump.php. (use pear install to get these)
- NEW: Create a 'zip' filter (zipFilter.inc) for smartforms. It can handle 5 digit and 9 digit zips as well as customized zips.
- FIX: correct check for existance of debug_backtrace function
- NEW: patch from Pascal adds directive tableBorderColor to SM_module
- FIX: bugfix in dbUniqueFilter when using non-default database handle (thanks to Tero Ykspetaja)
- FIX: fix fatal typo in dbunique filter
- FIX: fix functionality of HTMLTITLE template tag (thanks Graham) 

2.5.1 Changes (release 6/23/03)
--------------------------------------
- FIX: SECURITY FIX: patch from Ron Kuris fixes a potential SQL injection vulnerability in the 
       default member system
- NEW: integrate waiting contributions (thanks to all!):
          - patch from Pascal Van Hecke to allow objects to be used in VAR tags
          - patch from Marinucci Luca to allow SM_object::getText to return default locale if the one 
            specified wasn't found
          - updates from Eric Anderson to add Postgre support to memberEdit.mod and dbUniqueFilter
- NEW: add smartForm directive (varExcludeList) to exclude specified session vars from propagating in a form
- NEW: add sortByTitle() method to select input entity (and it's decendants). sorts options in the select
       list by alphabetical order

2.5.0 Changes (release 6/16/03)
--------------------------------------
- NEW: add ability to use templates to customize output of switchBox entity
- NEW: if not in develState, don't maintain debug log. saves some memory/time in larger sites.
- NEW: input entities now throw a debugLog warning when a filter fails. this makes it easier to see why
       a form isn't getting to dataVerified()
- NEW: add poolSelectEntity. this entity sets up two select boxes: one containing a "pool" of items (on left).
       one containing a list of items that have been selected from the pool (on right). there are arrow buttons
       between the two select boxes to transfer items between being selected and being available in the pool.
       the entity provides a simple method (getActionList()) to get an array of items that either need to be
       removed or added. see lib/sfInputEntities/poolSelectEntity.inc
- NEW: add optional anchor parameter support to various SM_session  methods (hLink, reloadPage, etc)
- NEW: add optional parameter to SM_smartForm::getVarHash(). it takes an array of variables to specifically include
       in the list of variables returned. if it's not in the list, it is not returned. this is usefull if you
       use loadForm() to get a list of variables in the form, and you wish to verify that the form was not crafted
       by the user to contain other fields.
- NEW: add the ability to load a smartform from XML data that was not loaded from a file (assumably
       loaded from a database.) the new method is SM_smartForm::loadFormData() and takes a string as
       an argument, which should contain the XML to be parsed.
