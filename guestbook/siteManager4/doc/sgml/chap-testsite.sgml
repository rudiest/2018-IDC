<title>Using The Test Site</title>


<para>
    The <filename>testSite/</> directory contains a full SiteManager site used for testing.
</para>

<para>
    To use it fully, you need to setup a database connection. Use the following
    steps to create the test user and database.
</para>

<para>
    Setup MySQL (or PosgreSQL)
</para>

<orderedlist numeration="arabic">    
<listitem><para>Create 'test' database if not already there</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><programlisting>GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON test.* TO testUser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'testPass'</></para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Create the test tables using the file <function>sessionBase.sql</> in <filename>tables/mysql/</> directory in the SiteManager root directory</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>    

<para>
    In <filename>testSite/admin/config/localConfig.xsm</>, the database settings are already setup 
    to reflect this. You should also check the "dirs" SECTION of this file to verify the paths
    match your setup.
</para>
    
<para>
    Otherwise, if SiteManager has been setup correctly on your system, and 
    testSite is in your web document path somewhere, you may point your browser 
    at the main directory and try it out.
</para>


<para>
    The testSite is also a great place to look for examples. You should find at least a basic example of most of
    the features of SiteManager.
